### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hey, my name is Andreas Herten and I like computers ðŸ’».

By profession, I deal with High Performance Computing, mostly using GPUs. I do that with a few of the largest machines in the world at [JÃ¼lich Supercomputing Centre](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/ias/jsc) in the scope of my [_Accelerating Devices_ Lab](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/ias/jsc/about-us/structure/atml/atml-x-dev).

Beyond that, my curiosity brings me to many destinations â€“ and leaving some half-ready projects on the way (which you might find here as witnesses of the past). I like Python as my go-to language for solving problems, and LaTeX to spend too much time on typesetting beautiful text.

You find me on Mastodon as [@andih@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@andih), on Xwitter as [@AndiH](https://twitter.com/andih), or on LinkedIn as [andreasherten](https://de.linkedin.com/in/andreasherten)
